# 🏡 DDD Home

## On what I decided to ~~waste~~ dedicate my time 🤔

DDD Home is a project about modeling the Home Domain.

Stuff I might model:

- Different users of the home like:
    - 👩‍💼 Leaseholder
    - 🧑 Lessor
    - 🧟 Guests
    - ...
    
- Home Rooms:
    - 💡 Living Room
    - 🛌 Bed Room
    - ...
    
- Utilities
    - 🧻 Toiled paper
    - 💧 Water
    - 🥖 Food
    

and how everything interacts between them.

I would like to focus on:

- Encapsulation (that's what we discover in the IT industry every 5 years 😂)
- SOLID
- Ubiquitous Language
- Proper Testing

What you won't find here:

- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
- High Availability System
